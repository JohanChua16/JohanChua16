Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Johan, a passionate student currently embarking on a double major adventure in (B.S.) Statistics & Data Science and (B.A.) Business Economics, complemented by a minor in Mathematics at the prestigious University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). ðŸŽ“

Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a love for turning raw data into meaningful insights, my academic journey reflects a harmonious blend of statistical rigor and economic acumen. I am on a mission to unravel the stories hidden within the numbers and leverage them to inform strategic business decisions.

As an enthusiastic explorer of the data realm, I've ventured into various projects, honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. My GitHub is a canvas where I paint my coding adventures, showcasing projects that reflect my academic pursuits, personal interests, and a genuine zeal for the world of data.

Join me on this exciting journey of discovery and innovation! Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a collaborator, or someone just curious about the intersection of statistics, economics, and data science, feel free to explore my repositories and share in the excitement of decoding the language of data.

Let's connect, collaborate, and code our way through the boundless possibilities that data has to offer! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
